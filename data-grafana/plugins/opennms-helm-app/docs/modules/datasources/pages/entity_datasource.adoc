= Entities Datasource

== General

Use the _Entities Datasource_ to retrieve entity model objects from OpenNMS.
It currently supports alarms and nodes.

(For an example of the entities datasource in action, see xref:panel_configuration:dynamic-dashboard.adoc#pc-filter-panel[Creating a Filter Panel]).

== Datasource Queries

The behavior of this datasource changes depending on which entity is chosen.
Attributes and values will change depending on the entity type.

NOTE: Currently the entities datasource only allows a single target.
Subsequent targets in the query editor will be ignored.

[[ds-entity-template]]
== Template Queries

To change the behavior of a template query (like a datasource variable), you can pass a function to the `query` field, with an optional attribute argument.

If no attribute argument is given, the query will return the `id` attribute of the entity.

The default if the `query` field is empty is `alarms()` (return a list of alarm IDs).

=== alarms([attribute])

The `alarms()` function will query the OpenNMS alarms ReST API.

=== nodes([attribute])

The `nodes()` function will query the OpenNMS node ReST API.
